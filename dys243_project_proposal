## Project Title
What is your time worth?

## What and Why?
This project would be a budgeting application similar to Mint. 
However, prices would be converted to how many hours the user would have to work in order to reach that price amount. For example, if working for $15/hour, to buy a $30 product the user would have to work for 2 hours. Putting prices in a context such as hours worked can help users better understand the time cost required for an item, which can help them make better purchasing decisions.

## For Whom?
The end user would be the general public, specifically the individual mass consumer.

## How? 
The user would need to input how much money they earn, whether it be yearly salary or dollar/hour. When the user inputs a price, it would convert that price to how many hours the user would have to work in order to pay that price amount. The application would link to their bank account, and keep track of the total hours the purchases add up to. It can break down how many hours the user has spent per week, month, year, etc. If the user wants to save up for a future purchase, the app will track how many hours the user is "saving" in order to meet the purchase goal. The application can separate between different categories of items, and display how many hours are being spent in each category.

## Scope
This will require a website that connects to a database that stores info about the user. Additionally, it would require a connection or a link to a bank API to gather the user's bank info. An browser extension could also be used to quickly convert a price into hours. The website should be within the prowess of 4-5 students during a semester. The browser extension could be unknown territory for some, so that feature may be left out.
